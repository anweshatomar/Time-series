# Wind Turbine Energy Prediction:

In this project we make use of a Wind Turbine dataset to predict the Active Power generated by
the wind turbine. As of now we make use of fossil fuels to be able to power our cities. If this
same consumption can be satisfied by wind energy we will be able to stop using fossil fuels and
in turn reduce our carbon footprint. We code various models such as average, naive, drift,
seasonal exponential smoothing, Holt Winter, Holt Winter Seasonal, ARMA and ARIMA.

## Conclusions: 

- Feature used Using Wind Speed (m/s), Theoretical_Power_Curve (KWh),Wind Direction(Â°).
- GPAC-(1,2),(1,7),(3,2),(3,7). All four combinations pass the chi-sq test therefore we move forward with testing the RMSE values and as shown in the presentation the RMSE of the combination (1,7) is the lowest.
 - Multiple Linear Regression model is the best, this decision was made based on Q values( 40.16520043050357).
